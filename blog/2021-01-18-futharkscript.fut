-- title: Futhark server mode and Literate Futhark
-- description: This post introduces yet another half-baked scripting language designed in less than two weeks.
-- ---
--
-- Futhark is a purely functional language designed for numerical
-- code.  It does not have the ability to do IO.  This makes it
-- impossible to write entire applications in Futhark.  You can
-- compile a Futhark program to an executable that will read input
-- from stdin and produce the result on stdout.  This is fine for
-- small-scale testing, but not useful for entire applications.  A
-- crucial limitation is that function parameters and arguments must
-- be of types that have a well-defined external encoding. In
-- practice, this means built-in primitive types and arrays of these,
-- with no support for records and sum types.
--
-- Alternatively, you can [compile Futhark to library
-- code](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#compiling-to-library),
-- which can be invoked from any language with a C FFI.  This works
-- well for real applications, and maps complex types to [opaque
-- structs](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c-api.html#opaque-values),
-- but is tedious when you want to play around with visualisations or
-- simple data analysis.  In this post I will talk about recent work I
-- did to bridge the gap, with an eye towards making it easier to
-- write tools that interact with compiled Futhark programs, but
-- without generating any custom C code.  I'll also show how I used
-- this new technique to write a new tool for notebook-ish "literate"
-- Futhark programming.

-- # Futhark server mode
--
-- When you compile Futhark to a C library, the resulting code behaves
-- like you'd expect: interim data is kept in some internal format
-- (and possibly on the GPU), the API exposes handles to this data,
-- and these can can be passed between entry points.  For those types
-- where it makes sense (mostly arrays of primitives), there are
-- functions for converting to and from ordinary C values.  The only
-- downside is that if you have a program with two entry points:

entry foo (xs: []f32) = map (**2) xs

entry bar (xs: []f32) = map (+2) xs

-- Then the only way to compose them without modifying the original
-- program is to write C code that first calls a generated
-- `futhark_entry_foo()` function and then passes the result on to
-- `futhark_entry_bar()`.

-- Why is this a problem?  Well, suppose you wanted to do
-- [property-based
-- testing](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing/)
-- and test the property *"any nonempty composition of `foo` and `bar`
-- functions will run correctly and produce an array of positive
-- numbers"*.  Normally we would build testing libraries in the
-- language itself
-- (e.g. [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck)
-- for Haskell), but Futhark is intentionally not sufficiently
-- expressive to do this - in particular, errors cannot be captured
-- and handled.  However, it is really awkward to generate and compile
-- custom C programs that link against the compiled Futhark library
-- whenever the tools want to test a case.

-- To enable these kinds of tools, I added a third way of compiling
-- Futhark programs: *server mode*.  This mode produces an executable,
-- but instead of executing a single entry point with input read from
-- stdin, the program instead reads *commands* passed on stdin, which
-- can load data from files, call entry points, save values to files,
-- etc.  It's quite
-- [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)-like,
-- except that [the
-- protocol](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server-protocol.html)
-- is not intended for direct human use, but is meant to be used by
-- tools.  Server mode does not allow arbitrary Futhark expressions to
-- be sent ([run-time compilation is not conductive to desert
-- survival](2018-06-18-designing-a-programming-language-for-the-desert.html)),
-- but you can call any entry point defined in the program.  In
-- essence, it's a thin text-based wrapper around the C API, and has
-- the same limitations (notably, entry points must be monomorphic and
-- first-order).

-- A session might look like this (with an artificially added input
-- prompt for ease of reading):
--
-- ```
-- > restore /tmp/whatever.in input []f32
-- %%% OK
-- ```
--
-- This creates a server variable `input` that contains an array of
-- type `[]f32` read from the file `/tmp/whatever.in`.  The server
-- responds with `%%% OK` when it is ready for the next command.  To
-- keep the protocol entirely text-based, all binary IO is done
-- out-of-band by writing to (typically) temporary files.
--
-- We can then call an entry point and put the result in a new server
-- variable:
--
-- ```
-- > call foo out0 input
-- %%% OK
-- ```
--
-- This runs `foo` on `input` and creates a new variable `out0` with
-- the result.  We can then pass `out0` on to another entry point:
--
-- ```
-- > call bar out1 out0
-- %%% OK
-- ```
--
-- And when we are done with a variable:
--
-- ```
-- > free out0
-- %%% OK
-- ```
--
-- A hypothetical property testing tool might do this any number of
-- times based on its own search strategy, and then write the final
-- (or intermediate) results to a file:
--
-- ```
-- > store /tmp/result.out out1
-- ```
--
-- After which it can read the value encoded in a [simple binary data
-- format](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binary-data-format.html)
-- from the given file, and verify that it is as expected.
-- Internally, these operations might have involved talking to the
-- GPU, or doing multicore execution - but the protocol is the same.
--
-- One significant upside of server mode is that we can run an
-- arbitrary number of entry points in the same process.  Previously,
-- our testing and benchmarking tools generated executables, and thus
-- had to initialise the Futhark context for every entry point and
-- dataset.  Context initialisation may involve GPU setup as well as
-- dynamic compilation of GPU kernels, which can take several seconds
-- - typically dwarfing the actual cost of running the code.  After
-- changing the
-- [testing](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-test.html)
-- and
-- [benchmarking](https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-bench.html)
-- tools to use server mode and keep the same program instance running
-- for all entry points and datasets, the time to run our [reduce
-- micro-benchmark](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/micro/reduce.fut)
-- dropped from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.  This is an extreme case, as
-- this program has 28 entry points with a handful of datasets each,
-- where actually running each dataset typically takes just a few
-- milliseconds.  But all benchmarks with more than one dataset
-- benefited, even if not to such an extreme degree.  Note that this
-- has no effect on the benchmark *results* - all we optimised here is
-- the tooling.

-- # Literate Futhark
--
-- I mentioned property testing as a motivating example above, but
-- that's not actually what I ended up using server mode for.  I have
-- long desired an easy way to write example programs that
-- automatically embedded the result of evaluating the code.  It
-- wouldn't be hard to use the Futhark interpreter to build such a
-- tool, but the interpreter is *super slow*, and sometimes I want to
-- show off programs that have a lot of computation in them.  Server
-- mode is exactly what I need.
--
-- For example, suppose I have this function:

def fact (n: i32) = i32.product (1...n)

-- Cool, right?
--
-- Now dig this:

-- > (fact 10i32, fact 15i32)

-- The blog post you are reading is actually a literate Futhark
-- program.  If you check [the source](2021-01-18-futharkscript.fut)
-- (and scroll down a bit), you'll see that it's a perfectly ordinary
-- Futhark program, with all the prose contained in comments.  The
-- expression above is written as a specially formatted comment,
-- called an *evaluation directive*:
--
-- ```
-- -- > (fact 10i32, fact 15i32)
-- ```
--
-- When we run `futhark literate 2021-01-18-futharkscript.fut`, the
-- tool produces a file `2021-01-18-futharkscript.md` where code and
-- prose has been marked up appropriately, and all evaluation
-- directives have been augmented with the result of their execution.
-- A Markdown processor ([Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) in my case)
-- then turns it into HTML, or whatever else you want.  Internally,
-- `futhark literate` compiles the program as given in server mode,
-- then uses the compiled program to process any evaluation
-- directives.  No custom code generation or run-time compilation
-- takes place.
--
-- So how does this work in the absence of run-time compilation?
-- Well, by cheating of course.  While the Futhark definitions (like
-- `fact`) are completely ordinary Futhark code and are processed by
-- the Futhark compiler as normal, the *directives* only support a
-- tiny subset of Futhark syntax called *FutharkScript*.  Considering
-- FutharkScript a language is borderline: as of this writing, all it
-- supports is function calls, tuple and record literals, and numeric
-- constants with mandatory type suffixes.  The idea is that you put
-- all the real logic inside entry points, and keep the FutharkScript
-- expressions very simple.  When `futhark literate` executes
-- FutharkScript, it does this by loading data with `restore`,
-- handling function calls with `call`, and finally using `store` to
-- obtain the results.  It works surprisingly well.

-- ## Fancier directives
--
-- Some functions results are better interpreted as image data than as raw numbers.

entry mkimg (h: i64) (w: i64) =
  let pix (r, g, b) = ((u32.f64 (r * 255) & 0xFF) << 16) |
                      ((u32.f64 (g * 255) & 0xFF) << 8) |
                      (u32.f64 (b * 255) & 0xFF)
  in tabulate_2d h w (\i j -> pix (f64.cos (f64.i64 i/10),
                                   f64.cos (f64.i64 j/10),
                                   f64.i64 i / f64.i64 h))

-- So we use the `:img` directive:

-- > :img mkimg 100i64 300i64

-- This requires the expression to be of a type that `futhark
-- literate` knows how to interpret as image data, and which is then
-- turned into a [Netpbm
-- 6P](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html) image file (because
-- it's easy), after which it shells out to
-- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to convert it to a
-- PNG file.

-- Now suppose we need to do advanced data analysis.

def linspace (n: i64) (start: f64) (end: f64) : [n]f64 =
  tabulate n (\i -> start + f64.i64 i * ((end-start)/f64.i64 n))

def xys f n start end =
  unzip (map (\x -> (x, f x)) (linspace n start end))

entry plot_sqrt = xys f64.sqrt

entry plot_sin = xys f64.sin

entry plot_cos = xys f64.cos

entry plot_inv = xys (1/)

-- The following directives shell out to
-- [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/).  Note how the labels are taken
-- from the record field names.

-- > :plot2d {sqrt=plot_sqrt 1000i64 0f64 20f64,
--            sin=plot_sin 1000i64 0f64 20f64,
--            cos=plot_cos 1000i64 0f64 20f64,
--            inv=plot_inv 1000i64 1f64 20f64}

-- I like the retro appeal of gnuplot's default settings, but maybe
-- you'd rather write the commands yourself:

-- > :gnuplot {sin_10=plot_sin 10i64 0f64 20f64,
--             sin_1000=plot_sin 1000i64 0f64 20f64};
-- set key outside
-- set term png size 1000, 200
-- set style line 1 \
--     linecolor rgb '#0060ad' \
--     linetype 1 linewidth 1 \
--     pointtype 7 pointsize 1.5
-- plot sin_10 title '10 points' with linespoints linestyle 1, \
--      sin_1000 title '1000 points' with lines lw 1

-- We can also do moving pictures!

def frames n h w =
  let pix l i j : u32 =
    let x = f32.i64 (-w/2+j)
    let y = f32.i64 (-h/2+i)
    let angle = f32.i64 l * (2*f32.pi / f32.i64 n)
    let s = f32.sin angle
    let c = f32.cos angle
    let x' = x * c - y * s
    let y' = x * s + y * c
    in if f32.sgn x' == f32.sgn y'
       then u32.f32 ((f32.sqrt (x'*x'+y'*y') /
                      f32.sqrt (f32.i64 (h/2*h/2+w/2*w/2)))
                     * 255)
       else 0
  in tabulate_3d n h w pix

-- And then it's just:

-- > :video frames 60i64 200i64 200i64;
-- loop: true
-- fps: 60
-- autoplay: true

-- This shells out to `ffmpeg` to produce a `.webm` file.  The
-- parameters following the semicolon are used to set attributes on
-- the eventual HTML `<video>` tag. The main downside of `:video` is
-- that we have to keep all the frames uncompressed in memory
-- simultaneously.  This is fine for small videos, but we'll probably
-- have to come up with a more incremental variant.

-- # Conclusions
--
-- I'm pretty satisfied with `futhark literate`.  I already changed
-- all our [examples](../examples.html) to be written in this style,
-- which has really [jazzed up some of
-- them](../examples/dex-sierpinski.html).  In particular, I like that
-- the source is still normal Futhark source code, and you can load it
-- into `futhark repl` for debugging like you would any other Futhark
-- program.

-- It's still a pretty crude tool however, and we'll add new
-- directives as time goes on - benchmarking (with multiple different
-- backends) is certainly going to be added.  I would also like to
-- extend FutharkScript with some handy impure functions for loading
-- data from image files and such.  Futhark as a language is in the
-- awkward position that by its very design, it is (intentionally)
-- difficult to do quick and dirty things in it, but being quick and
-- dirty is still very useful for showing off the language!  I hope
-- tools such as `futhark literate` can make it easy to explain and
-- visualise Futhark code, without complicating the language itself.
--
-- It would be nice if FutharkScript did not require type suffixes on
-- number literals.  Perhaps a small amount of type inference would be
-- in order, or maybe just implicit conversions... it is a *-Script*
-- language, after all.
--
-- Another issue is that all directives are recomputed whenever
-- `futhark literate` runs.  This can be annoying when you have
-- (relatively) long-running directives such as the video above, which
-- remain unchanged while you work elsewhere in the document.
-- Temporarily commenting them out works, but it would be nicer if
-- `futhark literate` could simply re-use the result of a previous
-- computation.
