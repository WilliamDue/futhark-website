-- # Dex: Multi-step ray tracer
--
-- The following is a port of
-- [raytrace.dx](https://google-research.github.io/dex-lang/raytrace.html),
-- which is itself based on [this Jax
-- program](https://github.com/ericjang/pt-jax/blob/master/jaxpt_vmap.ipynb)
-- by Eric Jang.  See [this blog
-- post](https://blog.evjang.com/2019/11/jaxpt.html) for details on
-- the algorithm - this example won't be getting into those details.
-- We've tried to maintain the naming scheme of the original program,
-- but we've re-ordered most definitions bring them closer to their
-- first usage.  This is mostly necessary due to the somewhat
-- convoluted program structure forced by the use of modules for AD.

import "dex-prelude"

-- The biggest issue is that the Dex program uses the `grad` operator
-- to convert distance functions into [normal
-- functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)).
-- Futhark does not (yet) support anything like this as a language
-- construct.  Instead, we use forward-mode AD with dual numbers,
-- which can be [implemented as a library in
-- Futhark](dual-numbers.html).  It works, and is reasonably efficient
-- in this case, but it is certainly *not* as concise.

module ad = import "dual-numbers"

module type expanded_field = {
  include ad.ordered_field
  val max : t -> t -> t
  val sqrt : t -> t
  val cos : t -> t
  val sin : t -> t
  val abs : t -> t
}

module f64_field : (expanded_field with t = f64) = {
  let max = f64.max
  let sqrt = f64.sqrt
  let cos = f64.cos
  let sin = f64.sin
  let abs = f64.abs

-- We expose all the definitions from `f64_field` rather than
-- repeating them.

  open ad.f64_field
}

-- The field implementation for dual numbers is mostly boilerplate.
-- We cannot reuse the `mk_dual` parametric module from
-- [dual-numbers.fut](dual-numbers.html), because that module chose to
-- make the representation abstract.

module f64_dual_field = {
  type underlying = f64
  type t = (underlying, underlying)

  let primal ((x, _) : t) = x
  let tangent ((_, x') : t) = x'
  let dual0 x : t = (x, 0)
  let dual1 x : t = (x, 1)

  let max (x,x' : f64) (y,y') =
    (f64.max x y,
     if x >= y then x' else y')

  let sqrt (x,x') =
    (f64.sqrt x, x' / (2 * f64.sqrt x))

  let cos (x, x') =
    (f64.cos x, f64.neg x' * f64.sin x)

  let sin (x, x') =
    (f64.sin x, x' * f64.cos x)

  let abs (x,x') =
    (f64.abs x, f64.sgn x * x')

  let neg (x,x') : t = (-x, -x')
  let recip (x,x') : t = (1/x, -(x'/(x*x)))

  let (x,x') + (y,y') : t = f64.((x + y, x' + y'))
  let (x,x') * (y,y') : t = f64.((x * y, x' * y + x * y'))
  let x - y = x + neg y
  let x / y = x * recip y

  let (x,_) == (y,_) = f64.(x == y)
  let (x,_) < (y,_) = f64.(x < y)
  let (x,_) > (y,_) = f64.(x > y)
  let (x,_) <= (y,_) = f64.(x <= y)
  let (x,_) >= (y,_) = f64.(x >= y)
  let (x,_) != (y,_) = f64.(x != y)

  let f64 x = dual0 x
  let zero = f64 0
  let one = f64 1
}

-- # Geometry

-- Sine we need the basic geometry functions of the ray tracer to work
-- with both normal and dual numbers, we define it as a parametric
-- module.

module mk_geometry(Float: expanded_field) = {

type Float = Float.t

-- The original Dex program implements vectors in three-dimensional
-- space with three-element arrays.  This is not optimal in Futhark
-- for [reasons explained
-- elsewhere](https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-01-13-giving-programmers-what-they-want.html),
-- so instead we import the vector module from [another example
-- program](3d-vectors.html).

module threed = import "3d-vectors"

-- And instantiate it with whatever `Float` type we have at hand:

module vspace = threed.mk_vspace_3d Float

-- Convenient shorthands for various vector types and operations:

type Vec = vspace.vector
let (*>) = vspace.scale
let (<+>) = (vspace.+)
let (<->) = (vspace.-)
let (<*>) = (vspace.*)
let dot = vspace.dot
let length = vspace.length
let normalize = vspace.normalise
let cross = vspace.cross
let rotateY = flip vspace.rot_y

-- These vectors are not arrays and we cannot `map` them, but we can
-- define our own mapping function.

let vmap (f: Float -> Float) (v : Vec) =
  {x = f v.x, y = f v.y, z = f v.z}

-- Dex calls the scaling operator `.*`, but that name is not valid in
-- Futhark.  Note that the `length` function will shadow the one in
-- the Futhark prelude.

-- Dex's `Color` type is from the
-- [plot.dex](https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/blob/main/lib/plot.dx)
-- file, which we're not going to implement in its entirety.
--
-- Much of the following is just as straighforward in Futhark as in
-- Dex, and so will not have much commentary.

type Color = Vec
type Angle = Float -- angle in radians

type Distance = Float

type Position = Vec
type Direction = Vec  -- Should be normalized.

type BlockHalfWidths = Vec
type Radius = Float
type Radiance = Color

type ObjectGeom
  = #Wall Direction Distance
  | #Block Position BlockHalfWidths Angle
  | #Sphere Position Radius

type Surface
  = #Matte Color
  | #Mirror

type OrientedSurface = (Direction, Surface)

type Object
  = #PassiveObject ObjectGeom Surface
  -- position, half-width, intensity (assumed to point down)
  | #Light Position Float Radiance

-- ## The signed distance function
--
-- This function is the reason why the Futhark implementation is so
-- convoluted, as we will need its derivative.

let sdObject (pos:Position) (obj:Object) : Distance =
  match obj
  case #PassiveObject geom _ ->
    (match geom
     case #Wall nor d -> Float.(d + dot nor pos)
     case #Block blockPos halfWidths angle ->
       let pos' = rotateY (pos <-> blockPos) angle
       in length (vmap (Float.max Float.zero) (vmap Float.abs pos' <-> halfWidths))
     case #Sphere spherePos r ->
       let pos' = pos <-> spherePos
       in Float.(max (length pos' - r) (f64 0)))
  case #Light squarePos hw _ ->
    let pos' = pos <-> squarePos
    let halfWidths = {x=hw, y=Float.f64 0.1, z=hw}
    in length (vmap (Float.max Float.zero)
                    (vmap Float.abs pos' <-> halfWidths))

-- With that done, the rest of the ray tracer can be written in a
-- non-modularised way, using just floating-point numbers.

}

-- # Working with the geometry
--
-- We'll need to instantiate the geometry module twice: once with
-- ordinary floats, and once with dual numbers.

module geometry = mk_geometry f64_field
module geometry_dual = mk_geometry f64_dual_field

-- To use `geometry_dual.sdObject`, we'll need to convert objects to
-- objects-with-dual-numbers.  For this, we'll first define some
-- utility functions.

let dual0 = f64_dual_field.dual0
let dual1 = f64_dual_field.dual1
let dualVec {x,y,z} = {x=dual0 x, y=dual0 y, z=dual0 z}

-- And then a bunch of boilerplate definitions.

let dualGeom (geom: geometry.ObjectGeom) : geometry_dual.ObjectGeom =
  match geom
  case #Wall nor d ->
    #Wall (dualVec nor) (dual0 d)
  case #Block blockPos halfWidths angle ->
    #Block (dualVec blockPos) (dualVec halfWidths) (dual0 angle)
  case #Sphere spherePos r ->
    #Sphere (dualVec spherePos) (dual0 r)

let dualSurface (surf: geometry.Surface) : geometry_dual.Surface =
  match surf
  case #Matte c -> #Matte (dualVec c)
  case #Mirror -> #Mirror

let dualObject (obj: geometry.Object) : geometry_dual.Object =
  match obj
  case #PassiveObject geom surface ->
    #PassiveObject (dualGeom geom) (dualSurface surface)
  case #Light squarePos hw r ->
    #Light (dualVec squarePos) (dual0 hw) (dualVec r)

-- The non-dual-number geometry module contains various useful type
-- definitions.  Instead of replicating their definitions, we make
-- abbreviations.

type Object = geometry.Object
type Position = geometry.Position
type Direction = geometry.Direction
type Distance = geometry.Distance
type Radiance = geometry.Radiance
type Color = geometry.Color
type Surface = geometry.Surface
type OrientedSurface = geometry.OrientedSurface
type Vec = geometry.Vec

-- We also need some of the geometry functions:

let dot = geometry.dot
let (<+>) = (geometry.<+>)
let (<->) = (geometry.<->)
let (<*>) = (geometry.<*>)
let (*>) = (geometry.*>)
let normalize = geometry.normalize
let length = geometry.length

-- And a few more shorthands:

let vec x y z : Vec = {x,y,z}

-- Finally we can define the function that computes surface normals at
-- a given position.  This function is the reason we went to all that
-- trouble with dual numbers.

let calcNormal (obj: Object) (pos: Position) : Direction =
  let f i =
    let pos' = {x = if i == 0 then dual1 pos.x else dual0 pos.x,
                y = if i == 1 then dual1 pos.y else dual0 pos.y,
                z = if i == 2 then dual1 pos.z else dual0 pos.z}
    in f64_dual_field.tangent (geometry_dual.sdObject pos' (dualObject obj))
  in geometry.normalize (vec (f 0) (f 1) (f 2))

-- # Random sampling
--
-- Since [dex-prelude.fut](dex-prelude.html) defines the same random
-- number generation interface as the Dex program, the sampling
-- functions are straightforward ports.
--
-- First, a function for generating a number in a range:

let randuniform (lower: f64) (upper: f64) (k: Key) =
  let x = rand k
  in (lower + x * (upper-lower))

-- Sample within a square with side length *2\*hw*:

let sampleSquare (hw: f64) (k: Key) : Position =
  let (kx, kz) = splitKey k
  let x = randuniform (- hw) hw kx
  let z = randuniform (- hw) hw kz
  in {x, y=0.0, z}

-- Sample within a hemisphere in the direction of the normal vector:

let sampleCosineWeightedHemisphere (normal: Vec) (k: Key) : Vec =
  let (k1, k2) = splitKey k
  let u1 = rand k1
  let u2 = rand k2
  let uu = geometry.normalize (geometry.cross normal (vec 0.0 1.1 1.1))
  let vv = geometry.cross uu normal
  let ra = f64.sqrt u2
  let rx = ra * f64.cos (2 * f64.pi * u1)
  let ry = ra * f64.sin (2 * f64.pi * u1)
  let rz = f64.sqrt (1.0 - u2)
  let rr = (rx *> uu) <+> (ry *> vv) <+> (rz *> normal)
  in normalize rr

-- # Ray marching
--
-- The essence of ray marching is simple: move along a given vector
-- and find the first object we collide with.  We do this the naive
-- way, by invoking the distance function for every single object.
-- This is not efficient, to put it mildly, but it is easy to
-- implement.
--
-- First we need a `minimumBy` function.  Despite Futhark lacking
-- Dex's support for ad-hoc polymorphism, which matters here as we end
-- up passing in the less-than operator, it doesn't end up looking
-- *too* bad.

let minBy 'a 'o (lt: o -> o -> bool) (f: a->o) (x:a) (y:a) : a =
  if f x `lt` f y then x else y

let minimumBy [n] 'a 'o (lt: o -> o -> bool) (f: a->o) (xs: [n]a) : a =
  reduce (minBy lt f) xs[0] xs

-- A scene is a collection of objects.

-- We can now define a function for finding the closest object, given
-- a position.

  let i =
    minimumBy (<) (\i -> geometry.sdObject pos objs[i])
              (indices objs)
  in (objs[i], geometry.sdObject pos objs[i])

-- When we ray march, we either collide with nothing and disappear
-- into the aether, hit a light, or hit an object, in which case we
-- also produce information about the surface, including the surface
-- normal.

type Ray = (Position, Direction)

type RayMarchResult
  = #HitObj Ray OrientedSurface

  | #HitNothing

-- The ray marching function is defined with the `iter` function in
-- Dex.  In Futhark, a `while` loop can express it in an equally
-- natural way.

-- # Light sampling
--
-- These definitions are pretty straightforward, and similar to those
