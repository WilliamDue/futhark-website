-- # Values
--
-- Futhark has various primitive types: eight different types of
-- integers (8 to 64 bit, both signed and unsigned), single and double
-- precision floats, and booleans. Here are some examples.

let an_integer : i32 = 2

let an_unsigned_byte : u8 = 2

let a_boolean = true

let a_double : f64 = 2.0

-- Numeric literals are overloaded, such that `2` can be any numeric
-- type, and decimal literals like `2.0` must be either `f32` or
-- `f64`.
