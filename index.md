title: Why Futhark?
---

::: {.container .tagline}
Because it\'s nicer than writing CUDA or OpenCL by hand!
:::

Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to
efficient parallel code. It is a **statically typed, data-parallel, and
purely functional array language** in the ML family, and comes with a
**heavily optimising ahead-of-time compiler** that presently generates
either GPU code via [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda) and
[OpenCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL), or multi-threaded CPU
code. As a simple example, this function computes the average of an
array of 64-bit floating-point numbers:

```Futhark
def average (xs: []f64) = reduce (+) 0 xs / f64.i64 (length xs)
```

Futhark is not designed for graphics programming, but can instead use
the compute power of the GPU to accelerate data-parallel array
computations. The language supports **regular nested
data-parallelism** and **automatic differentiation**, as well as a
form of imperative-style in-place modification of arrays, while still
preserving the purity of the language via the use of a **uniqueness
type system**.

While the Futhark language and compiler is an **ongoing research
project**, it is quite usable for real programming, and can compile
nontrivial programs which then run on real machines at high speed.

Futhark is a simple language and is designed to be easy to learn,
although it omits some common features in order to generate
high-performance parallel code. Nevertheless, **Futhark can already be
used for nontrivial programs**. We are actively looking for more
potential applications as well as people who are interested in
contributing to the language design.

**Futhark is not intended to replace existing general-purpose
languages**. The intended use case is that Futhark is only used for
relatively small but compute-intensive parts of an application. The
Futhark compiler generates code that can be **easily integrated with
non-Futhark code**. For example, you can compile a Futhark program to a
Python module that internally uses
[PyOpenCL](https://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl/) to execute code
on the GPU, yet looks like any other Python module from the outside
([more on this here](/blog/2016-04-15-futhark-and-pyopencl.html)). The
Futhark compiler will also generate more conventional C code, which can
be accessed from any language with a basic FFI ([an example
here](/blog/2017-09-26-calling-futhark-from-c-and-haskell.html)).

or maybe the [docs](/docs.html), which also contains a list of our
[publications](/publications.html). You can of course also visit our
